                Education is a primary need for any community, which helps build a strong bond with
                the next generation. In line with this thought, NSLNSS has entered into an agreement
                with <a href="https://svym.org/" target="_blank" class="highlight">SVYM</a> who are
                a leading name in medical & education services in India.

                The work on the project at Government School, Nuggehalli is an effort in holistic
                development which will help us spread out into education as well, rather than
                restrict ourselves to religious activities alone.
