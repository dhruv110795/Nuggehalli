              <p>
                Situated in this quiet & quaint village are five to six 11th century temples, of
                which two are a treasure trove of architecture. The aura of the temples are felt by
                visiting these temples. However due to neglect of these grand edifices by the
                Government / Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), people having a lineage to
                Nuggehalli came together more than 40yrs ago to form a society under the name
                Nuggehalli Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Seva Samithi for the upkeep of the temples &
                to ensure the day to day ‘pooja’s’ are performed to the almighty as per the
                ‘shastras’.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The historical temples of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha & Sadashiva at Nuggehalli belonging
                to 11th century Hoysala period architecture is a must visit place of
                tourist/cultural importance. The sculptures in the temple tease the mind with a
                beauty that would linger in one’s mind for ages. These wonderful temples come under
                the purview of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and they have classified
                these as the “Living Temple – Monument”, (which are very few in number) wherein the
                pooja to the Almighty is being performed uninterrupted from day one. This
                classification is given to about 50 odd temples in India. Karnataka is indeed
                fortunate to have quite a few of these temples which have a Great & Hoary past.

                      Nuggehalli is a village & Hobli HQ in Hassan district of Karnataka. It is
                      16kms northeast of Channarayapatna & 16kms east of Hiresave on NH 47 & is very
                      close to Sravanabelgola (28Kms). The deviation to both Nuggehalli &
                      Sravanabelogola is from Hiresave & one could reach Nuggehalli from Bangalore
                      within three hrs.

                    <p>
                      Nuggehalli used to be a flourishing town as seen in the inscription Ch.238. &
                      an ancient place near which the Chola king is said to have constructed a
                      temple of ‘Jayagondeshwara’ & to which the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana gave
                      some grants in 1121 A.D. A number of temples dedicated to ‘Vishnu & his
                      incarnation’ were constructed during the reign of Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana.
                      The Jain King came under the profound influence of the Srivaishnava saint Sri
                      Ramanujacharya. (It was during this time an impetus to Hinduism over the then
                      religion of Jainism – as signified by the sculptures & basadies of
                      Sravanabelgola gained strength) & had several such temples constructed in his
                      kingdom.

                      The original Hoysala temple appears to have had a Mahadvara or upparige of
                      soapstone supported by plain round pillars. In front of the Mahadvara stood
                      the two fine elephants, which are now in front of the Hajara (inner
                      Courtyard). The elephants are well carved and an equestrian is cantering on
                      either side of the trunk of each. Ahead of the Mahadwara (in the west), a part
                      of the courtyard stands a platform about four feet high on which the temple is
                      raised.
